# AspFilterBoxLibrary

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.1.

## Generating a new angular workspace & project

Run `ng new my-project-lib`. Optionally run: `ng new my-project-lib --createApplication=false` to generate a new angular workspace without a project.

## Generate a new library

Run `ng generate library my-lib` to generate a new my-lib inside src/projects. Adding the `-p my-lib` flag, adds a prefix to the library (recommended).

## Build the library

Run `ng build my-lib` to build the library. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Adding the `--watch` flag while developing, allows to see the imediate changes.

## Running unit tests on the library

Run `ng test my-lib` to execute the unit test via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Library access points

The public-api.ts file defines what is available for the consumers. Use a NgModule to expose services and components. A consumer of the library should be able to acces public functionality through a single import path.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
